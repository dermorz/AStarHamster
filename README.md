*(Freizeit-/Berufsschulprojekt)*

This is some code I wrote during my apprenticeship. It implements A* and TSP for the Hamstersimulator. The code is documented here and there but not refactored at all, so don't look for best practices in it. It is more or less just a proof of an idea.

I didn't test the code with the most recent version of Hamstersimulator. It was written in late 2010.

And please just don't copy this code for your homeworks. If your teacher asks you to explain it, you have a problem. Instead read the guide linked in the source code and try to implement it yourself.

*(I know the .ham-file is kind of redundant, but it is the file which you edit in the Hamstersimulator-editor. The Hamstersimulator generates the .java from it.)*
